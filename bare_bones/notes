this is how to build the view

 V = S( vm( M.present( A(data) ) ), nap(M))

 S - State Representation. Produces the view.
 A - Actions that can trigger a change in the model.
 M - The model.

 nap - Next Action Predicate. A Callback that is invoked after the model is updated. Ensures functions are pure. Can be null.
